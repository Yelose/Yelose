   * Right in the beginning of the bootcamp I thought about making a simple website where I insert my [exercises](https://yelose.github.io/f5exercises/)      
   * Learning JS, I just felt like making a simple [2 players local game](https://github.com/Yelose/dice150) wich actually helped me to understand JavaScript
