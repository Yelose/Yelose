### Hi there 👋
🌱 I'm a junior **full-stack developer**, training in Factoria F5. <br>
🏆 **Finalist** in Hackaton July-2022, Factoria F5. <br>
😎 I really love this job, learning and creating new things every day, looking for information, brain storming, and team work. <br>
👥 I am an empath person, I love interacting with people, everywhere I work I adapt and carry out activities based on the needs the people express. <br>
🦸‍♀️ I handle changes with ease.<br>
⚡ Paying attention, showing curiosity, having motivation, being determined, sticking to it, participating, and having initiative are some of my valuable skills.<br>
<br>

<details><summary>Personal projects</summary>

   * Right in the beginning of the bootcamp I thought about making a simple website where I insert my [exercises](https://yelose.github.io/f5exercises/)      
   * Learning JS, I just felt like making a simple [2 players local game](https://github.com/Yelose/dice150) wich actually helped me to understand JavaScript
